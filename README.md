# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a computer vision project focused on recognizing and classifying handwritten digits. The primary objective is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify digits (0-9) from handwritten images. This project is often used as a foundational example in machine learning and computer vision for understanding image classification tasks.

## Key Features

- Image Preprocessing: Prepare and preprocess handwritten digit images for model input.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Utilize a deep learning architecture, specifically CNN, for digit recognition.
- Training and Validation: Train the model on a labeled dataset and validate its performance.
- Inference: Deploy the trained model for predicting digits in new handwritten images.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Gather a dataset of handwritten digits, such as MNIST or a custom dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and augment the images to prepare them for training.
3. **Model Architecture:** Define and train a CNN model for digit recognition using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
4. **Training:** Train the model on the labeled dataset, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.
5. **Validation:** Assess the model's performance on a separate validation dataset to ensure generalization.
6. **Inference:** Deploy the model for recognizing handwritten digits in new images.
